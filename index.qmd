## Coarsened Exact Matching
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨

Marry cutting-edge supervised discretion algorithms [@kurgan_caim_2004]
(need to find truly cutting-edge methods, but this seems to be the canonical
example) with coarsened exact matching (CEM) [@iacus_causal_2012] to improve
the recovery of true causal parameter(s) with CEM.

## Causal Benchmark
**Status**: ðŸŸ©

There has been a recent influx in methods for ATE and HTE estimation, and
particularly in methods that harness or build on ML algorithms. While each 
method relies on underlying assumptions (many assumptions are common 
across methods), and the estimation method of choice will likely depend on
the relevant setting, there are often multiple estimation strategies that could
be suitable in a given setting. Practitioners facing this decision suffer a
lack of information on the relative pros and cons of the various estimators.
This project will provide practical insight on the pros and cons of common
HTE estimators by benchmarking them on a set of RCTs, treating the published
results as ground truth for our causal estimators.
